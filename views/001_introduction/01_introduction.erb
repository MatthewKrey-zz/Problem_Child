      <h1>PROBLEM CHILD</h1>
      <h2>the web application that helps you understand why.</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Why am I drawing a circle? Why am I adding two numbers together? Why is it so cool that I can draw a smiley face on my computer screen?

Before learning how to code, many people are not exposed to the practical benefits of programming. <br><br>PROBLEM CHILDâ€™s mission is to show you how programming can help you make your life, and the lives of others, easier through code.

<br><br>You are going to assume the role of our Founder. And you are going to build our website.</p>
